# Installing from source on Linux with dmd


## 1: Install DMD dependencies.
DMD depends on `gcc-multilib`, so you need to install it with your package manager. On Debian/Ubuntu, you can install it with:

    sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib


## 2: Download DMD
Get the newest DMD 2.x binary package for your OS from here: 
<http://www.digitalmars.com/d/download.html>


## 3: Install DMD
Install the package using your system's package manager.

The deb package works fine on most (all?) Debian based distros, including Debian and Ubuntu.

If you're using a 64-bit OS, you will need to force architecture as there is only a 32-bit package available. On Debian/Ubuntu, this can be done with:

    sudo dpkg -i --force-architecture dmd_2.YOUR_VERSION_HERE_i386.deb


## 4: Install DPong dependencies
You will need SDL 1.2 and FreeType, so install them with your package manager. It's possible that you already have them, as many projects depend on them. On Debian/Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2debian libfreetype6


## 5: Get DPong
You can download DPong source tarball from its GitHub page:
<https://github.com/kiith-sa/DPong>

Or you can download the source repository using git:

    git clone git://github.com/kiith-sa/DPong.git


## 6: Compile and install DPong
Move to to the directory where you downloaded DPong source (this is the directory that contains the `cdc.d` file).

First, compile the CDC build script:

    dmd cdc.d

Now, you need to compile DPong release build target:

    ./cdc release
 
You can also compile a debug build, but the release build is the one that will get installed. For more info about DPong build targets, type `./cdc --help` .

Now you can install DPong:

    sudo ./install.sh

DPong release build will be copied to `/usr/bin/dpong.bin` and a launcher script to `/usr/bin/dpong` so you can now launch dpong by typing `dpong` into the console. Game data files will be copied to `usr/local/share/dpong`. DPong will store user settings and similar data in  `/home/YOUR_USER_NAME/.dpong` .
