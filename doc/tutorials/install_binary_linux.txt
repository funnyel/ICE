# Installing on linux from a binary tarball

## 1: Install dependencies
You will need SDL 1.2 and FreeType, so install them with your package manager. It's possible that you already have them, as many projects depend on them. On Debian/Ubuntu, you can do this by typing the following command into the console:

    sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2debian libfreetype6

## 2. Download tarball for your architecture
Currently, only 32bit and 64bit x86 is supported. You can download tarballs at
<https://github.com/downloads/kiith-sa/DPong/dpong-linux-x86.tgz> for 32 bit and
<https://github.com/downloads/kiith-sa/DPong/dpong-linux-x64.tgz> for 64 bit.

Extract the tarball wherever you want.

No more installation is needed. You can launch game binaries directly from
the top level directory of the tarball, using your file manager or by typing e.g.
`./pong-release.x64` for a release x86-64 build.
