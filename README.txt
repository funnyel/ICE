# DPong version 0.5.0 #


## Introduction ##

DPong is a fast-paced Pong remake with nice, vector style graphics
written in the D programming language.

At the moment, DPong is unfinished and is still missing sounds and multiplayer.
These should be added in the coming releases.


## Gameplay ##
The goal of the game is to use your paddle to throw the ball behind the other 
player's paddle. You control your paddle with directional arrows.
You can take screenshots using the Scroll Lock button. Screenshots
can be found in `.dpong/main/screenshots` in your home directory.


## Compiling/Installing ##

### Directory structure ###
*   `./`    
    This README file, utility scripts, DPong sources outside of any packages.

*   `./data`    
    Main game data directory, contains game data that is never modified.

*   `./user_data`    
    User game data directory, contains modifyable user data such as screenshots, etc.

*   `./dependencies`    
    Source code of libraries DPong depends on (only derelict at the moment)

*   `./doc`    
    Documentation.

*   `./xxx`    
    Other directories: DPong source files.


### Requirements ###
DPong is written in D1, so it requires a working D1 compiler such as dmd or gdc.
DPong also depends on SDL 1.2, FreeType, OpenGL, and Derelict, 
source of which is included for convenience,


### Compiling/Installing on Linux ##
First, ensure you have all dependencies, as specified above, installed.

DPong uses a D script, `cdc.d` for compilation. In order to compile, you first have
to compile `cdc.d` by typing following commands, for dmd an gdc respectively:

    dmd cdc.d #dmd

    gdc cdc.d -o cdc #gdc


To compile dpong, use the following command, which will build the release build target.
This should take about a minute with dmd, or a few minutes with gdc.
Alternatively, you can consult `cdc --help` for specific build targets - 
you need the release target if you want to install using the install.sh script.
    
    ./cdc release

If you don't want to install, you can run DPong from the package's top
level directory by launching `./pong-release` binary or binary of any
other build target.

To install, run following command as root (e.g. by using `sudo`):

    ./install.sh

This will copy the release binary to `/usr/bin/dpong.bin` , and a simple
launcher script to `/usr/bin/dpong`. Main game data will be copied
to `/usr/local/share/dpong` and DPong will create a `.dpong/` subdirectory in
your home directory.
