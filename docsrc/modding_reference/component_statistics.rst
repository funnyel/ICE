Statistics component
====================

Currently, Statistics component can't be used from YAML, only by internal game
logic. This might change in future. It specifies which entity is the owner of
an entity (for example, a ship is an owner of projectiles it fires).  Trying to
use Statistics component in YAML is currently an error.
